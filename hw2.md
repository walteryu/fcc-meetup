# Free Code Camp Meetup - Software Engineering Basics

## Programming Languages - Python, Ruby and JS

### Homework 2

The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce learning and practice from the FCC workshop. Collaboration is definitely encouraged, so please partner with fellow FCC members to complete this assignment! Learning to code also means learning about how to communicate and collaborate with other programmers.

Learning objectives are as follows:

1. Basic understanding of programming languages; their applications and importance
2. Complete recommended reading and bookmark for future reference
3. Clone and experiment with examples in your Github account

## Exercise 1 -  Select Programming Language

HW1 covered command line basics and some bash scripting, so now it is time to practice some more with a language of your choice! Listed below are some resources for 3 of the most popular: Python, Ruby and JS. Although it is not a comprehensive list, you are encouraged to experiment with any other ones that may interest you.

Book Publishers - Also not a comprehensive list, but here are some major publishers for programming books:
1. [Learn Code the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/)
2. [O'Reilly Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/)
3. [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/)
4. [Lean Pub](https://leanpub.com/)
5. [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/)

Free Online Courses - Listed below are several resources; most courses have a free version:
1. [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming)
2. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=programming)
3. [Microsoft Professional Program](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/)

Python - General programming language, typically used for web development and data science:
1. [Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/)
2. [Learn Python Tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/)
3. [edX Online Courses](https://www.edx.org/learn/python)

Ruby - General programming language, typically used for web development:
1. [Learn Ruby](https://www.learnrubyonline.org/)
2. [FCC Article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learning-ruby-from-zero-to-hero-90ad4eecc82d)
3. [Ruby Learning](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html)

JS - Typically used for web development and has advantage of being full-stack (front to back-end):
1. [Learn JS](https://www.learn-js.org/)
2. [Modern JS Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
3. [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

## Exercise 2 - Complete Installations

Although it is possible to practice programming with develop environments, you will eventually need to install it on your machine in order to develop more seriously. As a result, follow the instructions to install Python and Ruby; JS may be run from the online environments or in the web browser [console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/).

You may run into errors when installing your selected language, so learn how to troubleshoot them! [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the industry standard for doing so, and you are encouraged reference it. If you run into an issue, then most likely someone has as well and posted their question there.

## Exercise 3 - Clone Examples

After installing and practicing with your selected language, now it is time to put it all together with Git and Github! Clone and experiment with the repositories below; also note that these examples may require additional software installation and if so, then repeat Exercise 2!

* Python - Microsoft Custom Vision [example](https://github.com/walteryu/trashspotting/tree/master/custom_vision)
* Ruby - Github Page [tutorial](http://www.stephaniehicks.com/githubPages_tutorial/pages/githubpages-jekyll.html)
* JS - Node.js and GIS [example](https://github.com/walteryu/ncic)

## Exercise 4 - FCC Guides

Review and complete topic for your selected language from the Free Code Camp [Guides](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/).
